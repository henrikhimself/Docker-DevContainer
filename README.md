# A dev container for creating PoCs, tools, documentation and managing notes.
This is a general-purpose development container for creating PoCs, tools, documentation and managing notes. It combines linux tools with VS Code extensions to become a Swiss Army knife for auxiliary tasks that supports my main development work.

My goal with this image is to have a portable environment that is opinionated and familiar regardless of whether I deploy it on Windows, macOS, GitHub Codespaces etc.
